This hackathon is designed to help aspiring cloud engineers gain hands-on experience with:
- AWS infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Serverless deployment strategies
- AWS Bedrock integration
- API Gateway and Lambda configuration
- Monitoring and logging setup

## Features

- 📸 Analyze product images via base64 upload
- 🤖 Generate detailed, sales-optimized descriptions using Claude Sonnet 4
- 💰 Get realistic price suggestions based on item condition and market value
- 🚀 FastAPI with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- ☁️ AWS Bedrock integration for AI processing

## Frontend Project

This is the backend API for the Sell My Stuff application. The frontend React application can be found at:

- **Frontend Repository**: [Sell My Stuff - Frontend](https://github.com/breakintocloud/hackathon-sell-my-stuff-frontend)

The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and displaying the AI-generated sales listings created by this backend service.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- pipenv
- AWS Account with Bedrock access

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/breakintocloud/sell-my-stuff-backend.git
cd sell-my-stuff-backend
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

### 3. Set up AWS credentials
Configure your AWS credentials to access Bedrock:
```bash
aws configure
```

### 4. Start the development server
```bash

pipenv run pytest
```

## API Usage

### Analyze Image Endpoint

**POST** `/listings/analyze`

Analyze a product image and get a sales-optimized description and price suggestion.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "image": "base64_encoded_image_data"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Image analyzed successfully",
  "description": "Beautiful vintage leather jacket in excellent condition...",
  "suggested_price": "$80 - $120"
}
```

### Example with curl:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/listings/analyze" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
